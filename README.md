# Exodus

A project trying to replicate function of [hypo/PDFTools](https://github.com/hypo/PDFTools) by using Haskell, Cairo and Pango.

It was almost complete but behaviours were not consistent with old PDFTools. There are several tweaks that CoreText does, and it wasn't easy to reproduce since I can't simply access source code of CoreText. So I leave source code here as a reference.
